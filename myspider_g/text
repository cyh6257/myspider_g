Postgraduate taught programmes
Normally a minimum of a second class honours degree or equivalent is required, and some programmes may require a background in the subject area or relevant work experience. You can check on our course list page for course-specific information.
If you have previously studied outside the UK, we would normally accept the equivalent qualification from a recognised university. If you are uncertain about whether your qualifications and/or experience meet the requirements of your chosen programme, please contact the Postgraduate Admissions Office.
You will apply for postgraduate study directly to the University, either:
Online Online application form or Via an International Representative
All of our representatives outside the UK are able to help international students apply. Please see our full list of international representatives or you can email our international recruitment team: sraagents@stir.ac.uk.

Once a decision is made, the response you receive could be one of the following:

A conditional offer, which means you have yet to satisfy the entry requirements. We will tell you what you will need to do to achieve these requirements
